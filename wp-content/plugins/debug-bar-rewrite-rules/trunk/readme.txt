Debug Bar Rewrite Rules adds a new panel to Debug Bar that displays information about WordPress Rewrites Rules (if used).

== Description ==

Debug Bar Rewrite Rules adds information about Rewrite Rules (changed via filters) to a new panel in the Debug Bar. This plugin is an extension for [Debug Bar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-bar/), but it is also can work in standalone mode (as admin tools page). Note: this plugin not able to track `add_rewrite_rule` function calls, for a reason this function is untraceable.

Once installed, you will have access to the following information:

* Number of existing rewrite rules
* List of rewrite rules
* List of available filter hooks that can affect rewrite rules.
* List of filters that affects rewrite rules.
* Ability to search in rules with highlighting matches.
* Ability to test url and see what rules can be applied to it.
* Ability to flush rules directly from debug bar panel/tools page.

== Screenshots ==

1. Testing url for matches - show  matched rules and actual matches.
2. Searching in rules list alongside with filtering and highlighting occurrences.
3. Interface of Rewrite Rules Inspector without Debug Bar.
